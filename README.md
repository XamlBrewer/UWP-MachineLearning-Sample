# UWP-MachineLearning-Sample
Demonstrates how to use ML.NET and Oxyplot to implement some Machine Learning use cases in an MVVM UWP app. Currently works against ML.NET v0.11.0.

## Look mom, no Python
The UWP app demonstrates the following Machine Learning scenarios. Focus is currently on the ML.NET core functionality, not on its latest API:
* Clustering
* Multiclass Classification
* Binary Classification
* Regression
* Recommendation (todo)
* Feature Distribution Analysis with Boxplot Diagrams
* Feature Correlation Analysis with Heatmap Diagrams

## Seeing is believing
